## Training outline
### Pre-requisites
- ES2015 (ES6) for React

### Introduction to React
- Introduction to the Virtual DOM
- Getting started with React – including it in your application
- Scaffolding a React application using create-react-app
- Understanding the project structure and build process

### Using JSX
- Need for JSX
- Built-in components
- Custom components (stateless)
- Introduction to props and children
- Variables and Expressions
- Example: Invoice Component
- Comments in JSX
- Conditional expressions and hiding and showing elements conditionally

### Component Basics
- Immutability of React elements
- Updating content by replacing elements
- More about children of React elements
- More about stateless components
- Initializing state in a class component
- Sending props downstream
- Basics of event handling

### Stateful Components in Depth
- Setting component instance properties
- Updating component state using setState
- Lifecycle methods – Mounting, Update and Unmounting phases and their methods
- Example: Countdown timer component
- Passing state downstream
- Parent-child upstream/downstream communication
- Composing components
- Example: Collapsible panel component
- Binding the context and arguments of event handlers
- Event object properties and methods
- Forms – refs, default state for input elements, uncontrolled and controlled components

### Routing
- Introduction to React Router
- Route configuration
- Handling params
- Using links to setup navigation
- Example: Product catalog application

### Redux
- Basic Introduction to Redux (due to time constraints, only the need for Redux and how to get started will be explained with a small existing demo)

## List of software to be installed before start of training
List of software to be installed before training starts
1.	Git CLI on participant systems and GitHub account for every participant (to be created individually by participant).  
Git CLI download: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
GitHub link for account creation: https://github.com/join?source=header-home
Once an account is created by everyone, the list of GitHub user names needs to be shared with me - I will add them to the GitHub repository before start of training.  
2.	Node.js needs to be installed on all systems. This will also install npm. However, the proxy server details may need to be configured to enable npm access the npm registry (this registry is required to download Node modules required to build Node applications - React is available as node modules and hence the requirement).  
Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
To configure the proxy for npm these articles will be helpful:  
https://jjasonclark.com/how-to-setup-node-behind-web-proxy/  
https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/npm-behind-a-proxy-server/19386  
3.	A modern IDE like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is highly recommended. If particpants prefer using one of Atom, WebStorm, SublimeText, Brackets, Eclipse, Netbeans or Visual Studio – that is fine. To download VSCode go to
https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
It is available for Windows, Mac OSX and popular Linux distributions.
4.	For browser – latest version of one of Chrome or Firefox, preferably Chrome. Internet Explorer is not acceptable.  
Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html  
Firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/  
5.	__IMPORTANT__: Additionally, it would be great if participants have as little restrictions (as permissible) on internet access during the session.
